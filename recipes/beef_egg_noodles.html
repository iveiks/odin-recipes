        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 pounds sirloin tips, cubed</li>
          <li>½ yellow onion, chopped</li>
          <li>
            2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed cream of mushroom soup (such as
            Campbell’s)
          </li>
          <li>1 cup milk</li>
          <li>½ cup red wine</li>
          <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package beef with onion soup mix</li>
          <li>2 (16 ounce) packages egg noodles</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute beef sirloin tips
            with onion in the hot skillet until beef is browned, about 5
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir cream of mushroom soup, milk, red wine, and beef with onion
            soup mix together in a bowl, pour into the skillet, and stir to coat
            beef in the soup mixture; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low,
            place a cover on the skillet, and cook until the beef tips are
            tender, about 2 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduce heat to lowest setting and continue cooking until the beef
            pulls apart easily with a fork, at least 4 hours more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg
            noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked
            through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain.
