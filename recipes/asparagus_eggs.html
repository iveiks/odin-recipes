    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
      <li>8 thin-stemmed asparagus stalks, trimmed</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and garlic;
        cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add asparagus and cook until fork-tender, turning asparagus often to
        ensure even cooking, about 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread asparagus out and crack 2 eggs over the asparagus. Cover with lid
        and cook until egg whites are firm and yolk is done to desired
        consistency, about 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle with red pepper flakes and serve
        immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
